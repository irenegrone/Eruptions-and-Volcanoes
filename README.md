# Eruptions and Volcanoes
Volcanoes and eruptions are a fascinating and very interesting subject and the Smithsonian Institution
(see Data section below) provide a well maintained and updated database open to the public and researchers.


### Description
The aim of this repository is to present an example of data analysis and visualisation in R: using mainly Tidyverse and Flexdashboard packages.
The code will include:
* 1 - Data pre-processing
* 2 - EDA
* 3 - Some feature engineering
* 4 - Presentation of results with dashboard using Flexdashboard (possibly also shiny)
